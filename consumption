## L4

main:
systick: tickless1: ~2.4mA
lptim1: tickless2, no stubs: ~2.4mA  (about expected)

wat-rtc-wkup:  (only wakes up with an actual nvic rtc wakeup handler?! surely I can skip that?!)
shutdown: ~660nA...
standby: ~790nA...
stop2: 27uA? that's much too high!  what else is on?!
stop1: 32uA?  LPUART at 32khz clock is still only 2.8uA*.03? it's not enoug!
stop0: ~138uA?  (no stop0 figures in datasheet)
sleep: 2.18mA (datasheet implies 1.3mA, plus ~3*gpios (diferent boaards, leds plus uarts plus buttons) + lpuart = 4.5*3 + 0.6 =>
             gpio*3 +pwr +lpuart+syscfg + rtc + msi
             4.5+4.5+4.5+0.6+0.5 => 14.6 * 32 => ~500uA
	     plus MSI at 32MHz is another 110uA => total datasheet implied is ~1.95? not too far off?
lpsleep(2): ~78uA (datasheet says ~43uA here, but we need to add 14.6*400kHz => +~6, still a little high)
lpsleep(5): ~170uA (datasheet says ~96uA here, plus 14.6*2 => +~30, still a little high)

Ok, so this is ~mostly good, except stop2/stop1 is "too high" and we need a real irq handler.



 BELOW IS wat-lp1!
MSI, RTC on, no special treatment to turn off gpios or make them analog

LP Sleep works without doing anything special to the debugger.  Stop mode you need to power cycle
to unpower debug, otherwise you'll see ~1.4mA or so.

LP Sleep, 1Mhz, ~108uA (datahseet says 65uA here, probably ok.)
LP Sleep, 100kHz, ~70uA  (datasheet says 33, probably fine here)
Stop2, 1.7uA (datasheet says 1.79, good enough for me)
Stop1, 7.3uA (datasheet says 7.19, good enough for me)
Stop0, 112uA ? (that one seems really high?) (no datasheet figure for stop 0!?)
standby: 720nA (doesn't wakeup properly!) (too high, datshset is ~236nA)
shutdown: 640nA (does't wakeup properly!) (too high, datasheet is ~64-112 for 3-3.6V)


## WB

HSE, RTC on, no special treatment for gpios

LP Sleep, 1Mhz, 440uA (datasheet says ~60uA, this is still way too high!)
LP Sleep, 100Khz, ~400uA, (datasheet says ~30uA, this is still way too high!)
Stop2: 43uA.  (datasheet says 2.2uA... Still seems too high, but totally workable...
Stop1: 50uA.  (datasheet says 10uA, this is too high, but I can live with it?)
Stop0: 156uA. (datasheet says 100uA, too high still, but....)

(I mena, BLE_Beacon demo uses ~55uA normally, outside the BLE spikes, so these numbers of mine are clearly fucking bullshit!)
